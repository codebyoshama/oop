# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts in Java

This guide provides a clear and concise explanation of the core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java. It is designed for learners who want to understand the foundational pillars of Java programming. Each concept is explained with real-world examples and Java code snippets to help solidify understanding.

Covered Concepts:
- **Class and Object**: The building blocks of OOP, representing real-world entities.
- **Inheritance**: Enables code reusability by allowing one class to inherit fields and methods from another.
- **Polymorphism**: Allows a single interface to represent different underlying forms (method overloading and overriding).
- **Encapsulation**: Bundles data and behavior while restricting direct access to some components.
- **Abstraction**: Hides implementation details and shows only essential features.

This document is ideal for both interview preparation and in-depth learning as part of a journey from junior to senior Java developer.
